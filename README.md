## Exploits 

## Breaking Boundaries: Exploiting Kernel Vulnerabilities to Gain Root Access and Elevate Privileges in Azure Cloud Shell - [A Real World Exploit](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kandiabhishek08_cybersecurity-azure-microsoft-activity-7239197172016013314-cIBp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 
- I discovered an out-of-bound write vulnerability in the **netfilter Kernel Module in azure cloud shell** version 
  5.10.102.2-microsoft-standard. This flaw could potentially allow a local attacker to exploit the vulnerability leading to 
  a Privilege Escalation and even execution of arbitrary code.
