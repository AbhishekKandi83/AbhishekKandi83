## Exploits 

## Breaking Boundaries: Exploiting Kernel Vulnerabilities to Gain Root Access and Elevate Privileges in Azure Cloud Shell - [A Real World Exploit](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kandiabhishek08_cybersecurity-azure-microsoft-activity-7239197172016013314-cIBp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 
-  I discovered an out-of-bound write vulnerability in the netfilter Kernel Module in azure cloud shell version 5.10.102.2-microsoft-standard. This flaw could potentially 
   allow a local attacker to exploit the vulnerability leading to a Privilege Escalation or even the execution of arbitrary code. I recently reported a privilege escalation 
   vulnerability in Microsoft Azure Cloud Shell , which has now been acknowledged and fixed by the Microsoft Security Response Center . üõ†Ô∏èüîí .I believe this exploit has 
   significant potential for real-world use and can be further adapted to target various production systems.
