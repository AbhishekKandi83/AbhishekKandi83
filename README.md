## A "Real World" Exploit , Linux Privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Kali Linux.
- Most computer systems are designed to be used by multiple users. Privileges mean what a user is permitted to do. Common privileges include viewing and editing files or modifying system files. Privilege escalation refers to when a user receives privileges they are not entitled to. These privileges can be used to delete files, view private information, or install unwanted programs such as viruses. It usually occurs when a system has a bug that allows security to be bypassed or, alternatively, has flawed design assumptions about its use.

- Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that an application or user normally protects. The result is an application with more privileges than intended by the developer or system administrator performing unauthorized actions.

## Objective
- This blog is all about security issues that could lead to a successful privilege escalation attack on any Linux based systems. We will also discuss about how an attacker can use the possible known techniques to successfully elevate his privileges on a remote host and how we can protect our systems from any such attack. At the end, there will be some examples to demonstrate how we achieved privilege escalation on different Linux systems under different conditions.
